Demo project RaaS Implementation

Go into index.html and look for: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.gigya.com/js/gigya.js?apiKey=<INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE>">

Basically insert your Gigya apikey there.

Also have in mind that if you are using this code in other site different to localhost you will have to whitelist the domain in Gigya's console. This can be done by anyone with Admin access to Gigya console.

You can also go into the js folder and modify the logic.js file to change behaviour and name of the screenSet names.
